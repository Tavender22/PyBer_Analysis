# Pyber Summary Ride Sharing Report
Prepared for V. Isualize

## Overview of the Analysis
This summary report was created to analysis total and average ride sharing metrics for our three city type - Urban, Suburban and Rural. After the analysis there are some conclusions presented to help PyBer with future planning.

## Results of the Analysis
![Summary PyBer Data Table](https://github.com/Tavender22/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/Analysis/PyBer%20Analysis.png)

### Total Rides
Our Urban cities vastly outnumber the other two city categories, driving the majority of our total rides and representing over double the combined rides of the other two categories.

### Total Drivers
Our urban drivers similarly outpace the total number of drivers in our other categories, representing over 4x the combined total of the other two categories. Interestingly, we see our urban drivers averaging fewer than 1 ride per drive (1,625/2,405), while both Suburban and Rural drivers are averaging 1.3 and 1.6 rides, respectively.

### Total Fares
Our urban fares are significantly higher than both the rural and suburban levels representing 9.2x our rural fares and over double our suburban fares. This is unsurprising as the urban population would be larger than with the suburban or rural population.

### Average Fare per Ride
We see our rural fares average a higher level per ride, over $10 higher than our urban drivers, and almost $4 over the Suburban drivers. Our Suburban drivers are averaging over $6 more than our urban drivers.

### Average Fare per Driver
Our largest discrepancy appears here between our three city types. We see our rural drivers averaging 3.3x urban drivers on the average fare, and over 1.6x our suburban drivers.

### Weekly Fares by City Type
![Weekly Fares by City Type](https://github.com/Tavender22/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/Analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)
Our weekly fares show some peaks and valleys for each city type, which is expected. Additionally, we see clear bands that each city type seems to operate in. Our rural cities peak at $500 a week, but are generally below this threshold. Suburban cities hover around $1,000 for6 weeks, and only have a few weeks below this level. They peak just under $1,500 per week, although we are seeing an upward trend as we head out of April at the end of our analysis.

Our urban revenues are consistently above $2,000 per week (with only our first time period and one other below this level). They also stay below $2,500 for the duration of our analysis period. The later half of April is seeing a bit of a downward trend.

## Conclusions
We have three conclusions based upon our analysis.
1) We have too many urban drivers, as they are seeing significantly fewer rides/driver than either on of the other centers. This is also negatively impacting the fares/driver, meaning each driver is not making very much money on the rides they do take. We would like to see the average fare per driver higher than the average fare per ride, as that would indicate that drivers have more than one ride on average.
2) Add a few more rural drivers. We may see an uptick in rural revenues as a result, and with the number of rides per driver and fares per driver being heavily skewed vs. the other categories we may be seeing lost revenue as a result of having so few drivers.
3) We should add additional suburban drivers as both our rides/driver and fare/driver are signficantly higher than our urban center, which may indicate there are adidtional rides available that we are not getting due to a lack of drivers.
